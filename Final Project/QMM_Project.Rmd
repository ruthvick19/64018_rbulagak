**Reason for Choosing Accuracy, Analysis, Presentation**

**Accuracy:**

*Ensures correctness of information.*

*Avoids errors and misinformation.*

*Establishes reliability and trustworthiness.*

**Analysis:**

*Facilitates informed decision-making.*

*Adds depth and insight to the project.*

*Demonstrates critical thinking and expertise.*

**Presentation:**

*Enhances communication of ideas.*

*Improves readability and accessibility.*

*Reflects professionalism and credibility.*

**Data generation process:**

*Conducted a survey among 15 students to assess three key factors influencing group successâ€”communication skills, time management, and leadership qualities.*

*Findings revealed insights into the perceived impact of Accuracy, Analysis, Presentation factors on group success, contributing to a comprehensive report with potential recommendations for enhancing group collaboration and effectiveness.*

*All three plays important role in total*

$$Total = (Accuracy + Analysis + Presentation)/3$$

*Loading the table of students along with the factors and their values*

#### Objective Function:


### Constraints: 

*We can see that there are a total of 15 Students in this Class Group, who are going to work on a class project by combining into a group of 3 each.*


*The Three Factors that are used to assess a individual student's performance are "Accuracy" (1), "Analysis" (2), "Presentation" (3).*

*Accuracy, Analysis, and Presentation were weighed between 1 and 100 based on Survey.*

*Total is defined as weights of each of the factors for an individual student,*


$$F_{ij} \: where \: i= Students \: ranging \: from \:1-15 \: and \: ji \: the \: Factors \:ranging \: from \:1-3$$
